# Recency Frequency Monetary Value
## [Detailed Project](https://nbviewer.org/github/davidefilosa/RecencyFrequencyMonetaryValue/blob/master/RFM.ipynb)


One of the most common methods for companies to segment their customers is a value-based approach.

The simplest and most used method is the RFM.

RFM stands for the three dimensions:

- Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?
- Frequency – How often do they purchase?
- Monetary Value – How much do they spend?

### In this project we will use this method to analyze the customer value of an online store.
